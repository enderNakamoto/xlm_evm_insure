## Project Description and Media

### What is your project description/summary? (Limit: 100 words)

HedgeWave Protocol is a decetralized parametric insurance framework. It enables trustless insurance using smart contracts and oracles that get real world data. Payouts for real-world risks such as flight delays, bad weather, earthquakes, wildfires or inflation are triggered instantly when smart contract conditions are met based on oracle data. Users purchase coverage in RLUSD and receive compensation automatically, with no need for manual claims. Yield-seeking investors underwrite risk in exchange for returns. The framework includes vaults, oracle integration, and liquidation bots. It is open-source for developers to build new insurance verticals.

## Development Plan and Market Fit

### In a few sentences, please summarize what you will build with XRPL Grants funding.

At ETHDenver, we built a proof of concept for a decentralized hedge against Turkish Lira inflation but had to cut corners on the protocol design to meet the hackathon deadline. With XRPL Grants funding, we’ll upgrade our smart contracts into a parametric insurance framework, with flight delay insurance as the first vertical and MVP. The system will use RLUSD for both coverage and underwriting on the XRPL EVM Sidechain, featuring vault-based capital pools, oracle integration, and liquidation bots—enabling automated, trustless payouts and real yield in RLUSD.

### What is your proposed project roadmap and key milestones (3–12 months)?

Over a 10-month period, we will take HedgeWave Protocol from a validated proof of concept to a fully functional, testnet-proven, closed-beta-ready product for decentralized flight delay insurance.

Month 1–2: Risk Vault Architecture + Protocol Refactor:
We will implement the Central Risk Vault architecture, replacing separate risk vault per market architecture with a pooled structure to improve capital efficiency and simplify investor exposure. RLUSD will be used for both underwriting and payouts.
More details here - https://github.com/enderNakamoto/xlm_evm_insure/blob/main/technical.md#central-risk-vault-architecture

Month 2–3: Oracle Infrastructure Update
We’ll deploy an Oracle Aggregator Contract and supporting off-chain ingestion scripts using Acurast TEEs or Chainlink Functions. This will modularize and decouple flight data from core contract logic for scalability.
More details here - https://github.com/enderNakamoto/xlm_evm_insure/blob/main/technical.md#oracle-layer-enhancements

Month 4–5: Flight Delay Insurance Interface
A dedicated UI will be developed for RLUSD-based flight insurance, including real-time flight search, policy discovery, and payout transparency. It will cater to both crypto-native and mainstream users.

Month 5: Automated Market Infrastructure
We’ll integrate frontend logic that checks whether a flight is already insured, and if not, trigger creation of a new Hedge Vault on-chain. This enables just-in-time insurance for long-tail flights.
More details - https://github.com/enderNakamoto/xlm_evm_insure/blob/main/technical.md#automated-market-creation

Month 6: E2E Testing + Liquidation Bots
Deploy to EVM testnet and simulate real user journeys—including purchasing RLUSD policies, oracle-based claim triggers, and investor withdrawal. We’ll also open source liquidation bots for executing payouts.
More details - https://github.com/enderNakamoto/xlm_evm_insure/blob/main/technical.md#decentralized-liquidation-bots

Month 7: zkTLS Flight Ticket Verification
Integrate zkTLS to verify that users actually have flight tickets, without revealing private data. We will use reclaim protocol (https://reclaimprotocol.org/), vlayer(https://www.vlayer.xyz/) or comething similar.

Month 8: Closed Beta Launch + Yield Study
Launch a closed beta on the XRPL EVM Sidechain and onboard test users and RLUSD underwriters. In parallel, conduct a detailed yield analysis using live flight delay data to model capital sustainability.

Month 9-10: Auditing + Risk Mitigation
Conduct third-party audits of all smart contracts and oracle integrations. Finalize mitigation strategies for edge cases such as failed or stale oracles, and prep for public release.


### Who are your target users and what is the general market opportunity?

Target Users
------------

- Travelers (starting with crypto-native flyers): We begin with Web3-savvy travelers attending events like ETHGlobal, Devcon, and Token2049—comfortable with stablecoins and self-custody. Over time, we’ll expand to mainstream users via airline and travel platform integrations.

- DeFi yield seekers: Users looking for sustainable, uncorrelated RLUSD-based returns by underwriting real-world risks like flight delays—offering an alternative to lending, LPs, or trading strategies.

- Builders and dev teams: Our open-source HedgeWave Protocol enables developers to build vault-based parametric insurance products for risks like wildfire, crop failure, and weather events.

- Future users across verticals: As we expand beyond flight delay, our user base will grow to include farmers, enterprises, and public-sector agencies seeking automated, event-based coverage.

Market Opportunity
-------------------

Parametric insurance is growing fast. The global market was valued at $16.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $40.6 billion by 2033, growing at a 9.9% CAGR (according to Global Market Insights and EIN Presswire). Growth is fueled by climate volatility and enabling tech like IoT, AI, and remote sensing.

One of the most promising applications is parametric flight delay insurance. These policies issue automatic payouts when flights are delayed beyond a preset threshold.

Blockchain enhances this model further. Smart contracts automate payouts. DeFi-native players like Ensuro allow crypto investors to underwrite these policies and earn yield.

The global travel insurance market is projected to reach $143.5 billion by 2033, growing at 20.1% CAGR. If even 10% of policies include parametric delay coverage, that’s a $3B+ opportunity—well-suited for blockchain-native products.

### Does your project have a GitHub repository?
Yes – https://github.com/enderNakamoto/hedgr

### Is your project already integrated with the XRP Ledger?
No 

### How will your project integrate with the XRP Ledger?

We are building on the XRPL EVM Sidechain, not the XRP Ledger itself. HedgeWave Protocol will be deployed on this EVM environment, using RLUSD as the native currency for purchasing insurance, underwriting risk, and processing payout

### What chains or sidechains are you currently building on?

We initially deployed on Sepolia testnet during the hackathon because it was the only network with a working RLUSD faucet. We'll continue prototyping on Sepolia, but we're open to deploying on any EVM-compatible chain with sufficient RLUSD liquidity—prioritizing the XRPL EVM Sidechain for mainnet launch.

## Traction and Monetization

### What is your current project traction and growth? (Include stats and metrics)

HedgeWave Protocol was created just one month ago as a hackathon project at **ETHDenver 2025**. At this early stage, we have **no active users**, **no transaction volume**, and **no wallet metrics**, as we are still in the transition from prototype to product.

**Current Traction**  
- Deployed an initial prototype on **Sepolia testnet** (due to available RLUSD faucet)  
- Received **strong validation** from Ripple mentors and ETHDenver hackathon judges  
- Conducted **user interviews** with crypto-native travelers and DeFi-native investors  
- Identified **Flight Delay Insurance** as the first high-impact vertical  
- User feedback confirmed clear **pain points** that our protocol can solve through automation and oracle-driven claims  
- Validated strong interest in earning **real yield in RLUSD** by underwriting real-world risks—yield that is uncorrelated with crypto or equity markets  
- Confirmed broader demand for **trustless parametric insurance**, especially in areas where traditional insurance is retreating

We are now ready to build on this early momentum and launch HedgeWave Protocol on the **XRPL EVM Sidechain**.

### What is your current financial runway?

We currently do not have any financial runway. We have not raised external funding or received any grants yet. This application represents the beginning of our journey, and we are applying to XRPL Grants to build something valuable with real-world impact.

### What is your monetization strategy?

Our current strategy is to take a small commission fee of 1–2% from insurance purchases and vault yields. In the future, we aim to support multiple insurance verticals by routing capital through our vault infrastructure, generating revenue as more users buy coverage and underwriters participate across different risk markets
